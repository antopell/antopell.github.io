        <h2>Description</h2>
        <!-- TODO fijarse si el texto queda mejor con font-monospace en class -->
        <p> This project was made in 7 weeks for the subject "Taller de programación" (Programming workshop). The goal was to recreate the classic 
game "Worms" which is a multiplayer game with a graphic interface. Being such a big project and with a short time for development, we were
adviced to divide the project into 3 parts so that each member of the group could focus on a specific section and completely develop it on their
 own. <br> 
It was a super interesting project in which we learnt to use many now tools and also improve our knowledge of others, as well as gaining 
experience working on large projects without instructions on how to make it. </p>
        <h2>What I did</h2>
        <p> The project at the beginning was divided into graphic interface/ client, server/ game and protocol and concurrency, the last being
the section that I decided to develop.<br> 
The protocol had 2 main difficulties. Fistly, it had to have a clear format that, not only, simplified its use, but it also had to consider the 
possibility that someone in the future, wanting to continue with the project, should be able to understand it without needing me. For this reason, 
the modularization and creation of methods that agilize the sending and recieving of messages was crucial. Secondly, it had to be tested
before joining it with the rest of the code (this was difficult due to the use of sockets) because if I couldn't test it beforehand, my teammates
wouldn't know whether a bug was due to a mistake in their code or in mine. Luckily, I could overcome those difficulties and every week I
could develop all the methods that my teammates needed.<br>
On the other hand, for concurrency I focused on making sure that the server didn't leak memory, that being joining all the threads at the right
 moment and free the memory.<br>
Both tasks (protocol and concurrency) were small in comparison to the work of my teammates. Because of that, I began to help with other areas/ tasks
and at the end of the project I've had developed the main menu (with QT) used for creating/ joining games, the configuration with YAML for the
weapons and values of the client, the fall damage (and generalization of recieving damage, apart from the impulse that the worm recieve when it gets 
hurt), the parabole of the projectiles (with its variation based on the power and also how the angle was sent to the client to render it correctly),
the implementation of the fragments of the weapons and the modification of projectile's characteristics based on the weapon's type. </p>
        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p> Firstly, the server must be started, then each client will be able to connect to the server and start the main menu. After the
client (now player) has joined or created a game the main window starts, where all the game is renderized. At this moment a screen showing the game 
id, so that other players can join, is showed. Then, the game will wait until the amount of players reach the minimum needed to be able to start.
Once that amount is reached, the host will have the option to start the game pressing "C". <br>
After the game has started, the available worms on the map are assigned evenly at random. If one or multiple players have less worms than the rest
they are given a life boost to compensate for the lack of worms. The game is then played by turns in which the selected prayer has a playable worm
(it changes each time the player is selected unless the player has a single worm left). During the turn they can move around the map, select weapons, 
collect supply boxes (which drop randomly every certain amount of time), and use a weapon.<br>
Each weapon has different characteristics, some have variable power and/ or angle, others the player selects where the target is by clicking on the map. Once the worm attacks it has 3 seconds to move and then the turn ends. If the playing worm recieves damage (it falls) or the timer finishes,
the turn ends. An important detail is that between turns the game waits for all the projectiles to explode and for all the worms to be still or 
dead/ drown because we want all the players to have a clear view of the game before the next turn starts.<br>
If a player doesn't have any more worms left they can continue to see the game and when there are only worms from a singular player the game ends and 
the game shows a victory or defeat screen to each player. After a couple of seconds the game ends and closes. <br>
During the game you can use "cheats", which we developed thinking about the testing of the game and the fun of the players </p>
